NEED:
- student list (including those that dropped)
- scoryst submissions
- extensions
- drops
- schedule a meeting with Keith
-


ANALYSIS:
- parse tree distance
- differentiate between successful and unsuccessful student patterns
- differentiate between effort required by student


FLAG GRAPHS:
- fix box alignment
- fix box coloring (line through instead of border)
- add username
- add submission numbers
- add submission times (as colored numbers)



TOLEARN:
- completion by time taken
- completion by start time
- completion by greatest deletion
- completion by greatest proportion deleted
- completion by longest attempted proof length
- completion by use/nonuse of rule (both in first 20mins + overall)
- completion by number of different rule types tried
- completion by use of bad rule (perhaps over time)

- time from first 15 minutes:


TODO:
a) the bars are printing too long, leading to overlapping
b) the bars are not printing in order

1) figure out what's going wrong with the visualizations
- print total time
- add breaks
- change from borders to lines
- add timeline to the bottom

2) prep for clustering
- time bins: (separate one for when they started vs whether they came back?)
-- 24hrs before early deadline
-- right before early deadline
-- 24hrs before onTime deadline
-- right before onTime deadline

- time measurements:
-- figure out median amount of time students take per step, ignoring first step
--- use for binning
-- figure out median amount of time a student take per step, ignoring first step
--- reuse for first step, given number of steps attempted

- total change in number of each rule type

- presence of bad rule
- presence of bad rule that lasted more than x time
- presence of bad rule that lasted more than x submissions




- number of steps with bad rule
- amount of time with bad rule
- percent of time with bad rule
- ending with a bad rule
- beginning submissions without rules
- restarts
- greatest reduction in of rules (across many steps)
-




-- change estimate to median amount of time, given the number of steps





DATA MINING!!!

filter out:
- empty submissions (no bys)
- people who never submitted anything

independent:
- start time
- time of day
- breaks
- first step
- how long to working first step
- how many initial lines
- largest number of tries on one step
- largest amount ot time on one step
- number of breaks / number of breaks per time spent
-- 5-15 mins
-- 15-60 mins
-- 61-180 mins
-- >180 mins
- how long they spend between submissions
- change per submission (just in terms of steps being used - with count of each step type)

dependent:
- success
- time to finish
-


bayesian knowledge tracing - Ryan Baker


time delta distribution








X all times plots

X startTime vs timeTaken

X timeDelta distribution plots

X first step length

breaks per time spent

absolute change in number of each step





long breaks

first step type

after 5 mins:
number of rules total
average rules in use

step that was missing the longest



flag graphs with time plots



how long it took, segregated by start time, without wrong answers
(- time bins:
-- 22hrs before early deadline
-- 22hrs before early deadline -> 2hrs after
-- 2hrs after early deadline -> onTime deadline):
- time of day
- breaks
- first step
- first step length
- breaks per time spent
- submissions vs time
- average change per submission (absolute number)
