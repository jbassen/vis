3-6: everyone that missed it first submitted in the last 24hrs or gave up after submitting early
* amccabe was the only exception (5) -- only had 5 submissions

7-11: everyone that missed it first submitted in the last 24hrs or gave up after submitting early
* kbishop was the only exception (11) --

The later you submit in the last 24hrs, the worse your odds are.





- people who first submit many steps at once, fix if necessary

- people who first submit with one or two steps
-- end with a small proof / large proof
-- grow quickly / slowly

* shorter time correlated with smaller backtracking
* longer time correlated with bigger backtracking
*
* shorter time correlated with submitting many steps at once
* lingering on a step is bad (getting stuck?)



-- only change the most recent step or two, if necessary
- people who first submit with one or two steps, get to large proof
-- only rarely do they reduce the proof length after getting a true result


* ratio of distance from end of proof and number of times it's repeated
* number of times step is tried before it "settles"
* number of different steps tried before this step comes appears

* time that goes by before the next step is found
** percent of time spent on each step type, on average, taking ordered repeats into account


(0) fix the data
((a)) change the first and gap lengths to being the median time taken by user
(())

(1) fix the visualization
((a)) up to down
((b)) borders to lines, black is bad!
((c)) fixed width per second (much wider)
((d)) add dot plots above each
((e)) add axis above the whole thing

(2) model the time taken by...
((a)) start time
((b))
((c))
